### What are you building?

Our team is proposing to build an application that allows a user to manage a collection of trivia questions.

### What are the initial features for the application?

The initial features include:

- Make API requests, to add trivia questions to the trivia question collection that the application manages
- Capture / store metadata for each trivia question
- Sort / filtering on metadata to create a subset of questions (for display / export)
- Exporting questions to proper file formats

What are the minimum additional features you plan to implement?
What are your stretch goals (features beyond the minimum)?


Go over your initial design.
    Special emphasis should be placed on how you plan to break it up
MVC, presenter, file management, different input validation, testing, documentation, etc.

How do you plan to break up the work?
